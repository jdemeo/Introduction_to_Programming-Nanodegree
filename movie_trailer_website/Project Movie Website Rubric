Functionality
 -Content: the page contains all of the required elements (title, box with art
 imagery, and trailer)
 -Python Data Structure: page is generated dynamically from a python data
 structure
 -Errors: code has no errors, bugs, or glitches

Code Review
  -Variables usage:
    -Code uses variables to avoid magic numbers
    -Each variable name reflects the purpose of the value stored in it
    -After initialized, the purpose of each variable is kept throughout the
    program.
    -No variable overrides Python's built-in values (i.e., def)
  -Functions usage:
    -Functions are used as tools to automate tasks that are likely to be repeated
    -Functions generate the appropriate output (usually with a return statement)
    from the appropriate input (function parameters)
    -No function contains codes longer than 18 lines (not including blank spaces,
    comments, variable and function definitions)
  -Appropriate Data usage:
    -The appropriate data types are consistently used (strings for text, lists
    for ordered data, and nested lines, as appropriate)
  -Appropriate coding techniques:
    -The student demonstrates coding techniques like branching and loops
    appropriately (i.e., for loop in a list, for element in list:; for testing
    if something is in a list, if name in list_names:).
  -Appropriate classes usage:
    -Code defines classes appropriately and uses instances of those classes in
    it.
  -Comments/Documentation:
    -All functions include a comment, which explains its expected behavior,
    inputs and outputs (if applicable).

Suggestions for improving project:
  -Add extra information about your favorite movies (screenwriter, launch date,
  etc.) and modify fresh_tomatoes.py to show it on your web page.
