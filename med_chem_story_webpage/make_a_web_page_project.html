        <h2 class="head2">Where to start?</h2>
        <p>
            Well let's start with an introduction, I'm your neighborhood medicinal
            chemist. And not that kind of <img class="mini_img" src="images/marijuana.png" alt="marijuana leaf"
            > medicinal. I'm talking
            about Big Pharma or Small Pharma or Biotech or whatever. But really,
            I'm just somebody who mixes stuff together and gets that stuff tested
            to see if it might be able to help a patient. I don't set prices, I
            don't determine layoffs, and I definitely don't get to publicize my
            work (legal is watching <img class="mini_img" src="images/magnify.png" alt="magnify glass"
            >). But I do get to chat about some
            generalities of my work and tell you how long it takes to make a drug
            because you have granted me this medium. I will share my pain.
        </p>
        <p>
            First off (well I guess I already said this) drug discovery is
            terribly difficult. To discover a drug it takes forever. My director
            finished up a project 12 years ago and with the greatest amount of
            luck, "the compound" became an FDA approved drug this year. Not many
            people can say they know someone that discovered a drug. Seriously
            people work for decades and come up empty handed all the time. To have
            that focus to make something that will hopefully help someone in a
            decade, you gotta have a big heart <img class="mini_img" src="images/heart.png" alt="heart"
            >.

        <h2 class="head2">And the years pass on...</h2>
        <p>
            So why does it take so long? Well that (12) years I stated before,
            that's just the "clinical" work. The testing in humans for "safety and
            efficacy" (does the drug do something good). Essentially, you're
            running a giant experiment directly on humans. Just try to account for
            all the potential variables in hundreds or even thousands of humans.
            Then hope you find some kind of correlation to keep pushing your compound
            forward, and hope that your compound is going where it needs to
            go in the body and not going somewhere you may or may not know exists
            in the body. Then hope that doesn't cause something bad to happen.
            Lots of hope gets us a failure rate of 90% at this stage. We aint winning.

        </div>
        <p>
            So why did I just describe something I actually don't work on? Well,
            "the compound" that makes it to that stage, is like watching something
            grow up. Like seeing your young pup start to sprout up in size. From
            not being able to get up on the bed to getting two paws up to finally
            jumping up and eventually to devouring your pillow when you're gone
            (that's how you know it's growing up). Well anyway, "the compound" in
            the clinic has that strong sentimental value. It was born out of some
            medicinal chemist's mind (until the robots take our jobs) and made into
            existance by those hands. So you just want to see it succeed.

        <h2 class="head2">What does a Medicinal Chemist do?</h2>
        <p>
            So what makes "the compound" so special? Well I can tell you that it
            carries the weight of all the "failed compounds". You start a project
            and test hundred's of thousands to millions or billions of compounds
            against your target ("protein X"). This is called a "high throughput
            screen". You essentially throw wrenches at a very sturdy engine that's
            been built with millions of years of self-preserving changes in hopes
            to slow it down because in "disease y", "protein x"
            is just messing everything up by being an over-achiever. But when you
            do that initial wrench toss, maybe 1 wrench or if your lucky 10 wrenches slow that
            engine down, but not really enough to call it a day. We call this a
            "hit". Now you go back and say, well can I redesign this wrench to be
            more effective at slowing the engine down. This is the job of the
            "medicinal chemist". That's me! :) I look at that slightly crappy wrench,
            and say "we can rebuild you, we have the chemistry" and technically
            alot of technology too. Just to note, I don't talk to my compounds.
        </p>
        <p>
            So we got this lumpy inefficient looking wrench, our "hit". And every
            week we refine and reforge it and then we toss that wrench write back at that engine and
            see if it'll slow down even more. We consider this as developing "SAR" or
            "Structure Activity Relationship". "Structure" being the engine and then
            "activity relationship" being how efficient does each of these wrenches slow the
            engine down. So week after week after month after
            year we keep developing our "SAR" to make that perfect wrench that has that right
            amount of stick to bring the engine to a crawl. And in parallel we start looking
            at this engine in icreasingly complex ways. We look at how do we get this wrench
            into the engine if the hood is down. This is what we consider "DMPK" (drug metabolism and pharmacokinetcs) or
            does the drug get distributed to it's target in sufficient amounts. Then we have to say well
            does this wrench mess up the thousands of other engines in the body. This
            is always the most difficult because well we don't know enough about biology and all the different
            proteins and what they do if we make them work faster or slower. I mean
            we spend a decade just to see what happens when we slow down one of those engines
            so how are we going to figure out the rest... Anyway, so we know a number of
            engines we don't want to hit, so you develop "SAR" against that
            engine too just to make sure your wrench has no chance of hitting it.
            We consider this "off-target" reactivity.
        </p>
        <p>
            So to speed up a bit, maybe
            we get all of our ducks in a row after a few years and we really
            probe whether our hypothesis of slowing down this engine will
            benefit our patients in a significant way. Well we then have to toss
            this wrench at what amounts to maybe an ATV or a golf-cart engine that is modeled
            after the disease in our patients. Let's assume the ATV and golf-cart
            engine are analogous to a degree and their workings are similar to the
            human engine we've been designing against (this isn't always the case).
            Well that wrench still has to find it's way to that engine, which is
            definitely taking a different path than with what we were designing for.
            Well now let's say our wrench gets into that ATV or golf-cart engine
            and starts to slow down the engine. Great! Now what did that do in the
            model. Well maybe that turned off the engine entirely and then it caused
            all the other engines in the body to stop functioning too...:(
        </p>
        <p>
            So now we have to ask ourselves well did we make a wrench out of
            plutonium and we shouldn't be handling it, or are we not suppose to slow
            down that engine in the first place...There is only one way to answer this
            and it's to make a new wrench that is shaped differently than the
            original and run the same test. So add some more time to the project,
            a year goes by and then we run that same test. And you find out well
            it shuts down all the engines eventually in the model...That's always
            a sad day. This is what we call an "on-target" vs "off-target" toxicity
            test. If both our wrenches cause all the engines to fail, we consider
            this "on-target" toxicity because that means that engine is critical to the
            functioning of all the other engines in the body. If the test comes out
            fine the second time around, we say that first wrench had "off-target"
            toxicity and we push the second wrench to "clinical trials". :)

        <p>
            Well I've written more than I really thought I would. I hope the silly
            analogy helped you to understand what a Medicinal Chemist does and what is
            accounted for when trying to design a drug. There's tons of variables
            being accounted for in design, but then you find out the one's that you
            don't know about are the ones that hurt you the most. Then you go
            back to the drawing board. Rinse and repeat. Thanks for readin. Cheers!
